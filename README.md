# Eenden

A simple flutter app to play a drinking game with friends. The game is called "Eenden". The app allows users to play the game with their friends and keep track of the scores.
I quickly made this game in 2 days to test out the flutter framework. The game is based on a drinking game called "Picolo" which is a popular game in the Netherlands. It is hosted on firebase because of the free tier and the ease of use. The app is not meant to be a full-fledged game, but rather a fun way to play with friends and keep track of scores.
